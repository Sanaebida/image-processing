# image-processing
This project contains some interesting image processing algorithms that were wrote in python from scratch.

# File TD2 IP 
Image manipulation in Python:
Install the required libraries
Read, display and save an image,
Apply elementary operations on an image(Addition, subtraction, Scalar multiplication, Translation, Rotation)
Implemented and tested the following functions on the attached images:
- Histogram
- Cumulative histogram
- Thresholding
- Reverse image
- Histogram equalization
- Exponential transformation

1 Contour detection using the second derivative of the Gaussian (Laplacian of the Gaussian)
The Laplacian of the Gaussian helps correct the sensitivity to noise issues in the Laplacian method (second derivative).
2 Edge detection using the Canny filter
The steps of the Canny detector are:
- Gaussian smoothing
- Gradient computation
- Non-maximum suppression
- Hysteresis thresholding
